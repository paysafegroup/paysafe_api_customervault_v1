# Authentication
<a name="apikey"></a>

In order for you to use the Paysafe REST API, Paysafe must first set you up on their system and provide you with an API key. Your API key looks something like this:

  * Key ID – MerchantXYZ
  * Key Password – B-tst1-0-51ed39e4-312d02345d3f123120881dff9bb4020a89e8ac44cdfdcecd702151182fdc952272661d290ab2e5849e31bb03deede7e

The case-sensitive API key is sent using HTTP Basic Authentication. To use HTTP Basic Authentication, you must send the API key credentials using the Authorization header with every request. The Authorization header is constructed as follows:

  1. The Key ID and Key Password are combined into a string separated by a colon, e.g.,“Key ID:Key Password”.
  2. The resulting string literal is then encoded using Base64.
  3. The authorization method and a space (i.e., “Basic”) are then put before the encoded string.

For example, using the Key ID and Password examples above, the header is formed as follows:

``Authorization: Basic
TWVyY2hhbnRYWVo6Qi10c3QxLTAtNTFlZDM5ZTQtMzEyZDAyMzQ1ZDNmMTIzMTIwODgxZGZmOWJiNDAyMGE4OWU4YWM0NGNkZmRjZWNkNzAyMTUxMTgyZmRjOTU yMjcyNjYxZDI5MGFiMmU1ODQ5ZTMxYmIwM2RlZWRlN2U=``

For additional details, please refer to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication).

  **Note:** Your Production API key will be different from your Test API key. Contact your account manager for details. You must keep your API keys safe and ensure that it is used appropriately for your needs.

# Getting Started

You can use the Customer Vault REST API to create Profiles, Addresses, Cards, Bank Accounts, Single-Use Tokens, and Mandates.This section outlines some common scenarios for using the Customer Vault. To get started you must first sign up for a test account and get an API key.

All examples in this section use cURL, which is a command line tool for transferring data using protocols such as HTTPS.

## Verify That the Service Is Accessible

The following request verifies that the service is up and accessible from your network.

Request:

`cURL -X GET https://api.test.paysafe.com/customervault/monitor`

Response: 

`{
"status" : "READY"
}`

**Note:** The system should respond with a status of READY if it is available.

## Create a Profile for a Customer

A Profile contains basic information about your customer, such as name and contact information.

To create a Profile you must initiate a POST request to the profiles endpoint.

            cURL -X POST https://api.test.paysafe.com/customervault/v1/profiles \
            -u devcentre322:B-qa2-0-53625f86-302c021476f52bdc9deab7aea876bb28762e62f92fc6712d0214736abf501e9675e55940e83ef77f5c304edc7968 \
            -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
            -d ' {
              "merchantCustomerId":"mycustomer1",
              "locale" : "en_US",
              "firstName" : "John",
              "lastName" : "Smith",
              "phone" : "713-444-5555",
              "email" : "john.smith@somedomain.com",
              "cellPhone" : "713-777-5555"
             }'
             
Prior to trying the example, you should:
  * Provide a unique merchant customer ID for each transaction.
  * Replace the [API key](#apikey) (after the -u) with the API key you have received.
  
**Response**
  
              {
              "id" : "716adb4f-6b85-4089-ba9c-d9c0eb649cd7",
              "status" : "ACTIVE",
              "merchantCustomerId" : "mycustomer1",
              "locale" : "en_US",
              "firstName" : "John",
              "lastName" : "Smith",
              "phone" : "713-444-5555",
              "email" : "john.smith@somedomain.com",
              "paymentToken" : "PyhYo1nGKUfWOPj"
            }
            
## Add an Address to the Profile

In the previous example you created a Profile for a customer. As a result, the API returned a Profile ID representing that Profile.

The Customer Vault API allows you to add multiple Addresses to your customer's Profile. To add an Address to the Profile, you must use that Profile ID and initiate a POST request to the addresses endpoint.

Prior to trying the example, you should replace the [API key](#apikey) (after the -u) with the API key you have received.

            cURL -X POST https://api.test.paysafe.com/customervault/v1/profiles/716adb4f-6b85-4089-ba9c-d9c0eb649cd7/addresses \
            -u devcentre322:B-qa2-0-53625f86-302c021476f52bdc9deab7aea876bb28762e62f92fc6712d0214736abf501e9675e55940e83ef77f5c304edc7968 \
            -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
            -d ' {
              "nickName":"home",
              "street" : "100 Queen Street West",
              "city" : "Toronto",
              "state" : "ON",
              "country" : "CA",
              "zip" : "M5H 2N2"
             }'
             
**Response**

            {
              "id" : "81ffcddf-ad82-40d2-aaa0-c4f9c376ad65",
              "status" : "ACTIVE",
              "street" : "100 Queen Street West",
              "city" : "Toronto",
              "state" : "ON",
              "country" : "CA",
              "zip" : "M5H 2N2",
              "defaultShippingAddressIndicator" : false
            }
            
## Add a Card to the Profile

The Customer Vault API allows you to store multiple credit cards against your customer's Profile. For billing purposes, each credit card can be associated to a different Address, or all credit cards can be associated to the same billing Address, depending on your business needs.

To add a credit card and associate it to the Address you just created, you must use the Profile ID (716adb4f-6b85-4089-ba9c-d9c0eb649cd7) and the Address ID (81ffcddf-ad82-40d2-aaa0-c4f9c376ad65) and initiate a POST request to the cards endpoint.

Prior to trying the example, you should replace the [API key](#apikey) (after the -u) with the API key you have received.

            cURL -X POST https://api.test.paysafe.com/customervault/v1/profiles/716adb4f-6b85-4089-ba9c-d9c0eb649cd7/cards \
            -u devcentre322:B-qa2-0-53625f86-302c021476f52bdc9deab7aea876bb28762e62f92fc6712d0214736abf501e9675e55940e83ef77f5c304edc7968 \
            -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
            -d ' {
              "nickName":"Personal Visa",
              "holderName" : "John Smith",
              "cardNum" : "4530910000012345",
              "cardExpiry" : {
                "month" : 12,
                "year" : 2019
              },
              "billingAddressId" : "81ffcddf-ad82-40d2-aaa0-c4f9c376ad65"
             }'
             
**Response**

            {
              "id" : "178ae2b8-85a5-4761-b1dd-4f14ac73571b",
              "status" : "ACTIVE",
              "holderName" : "John Smith",
              "cardBin" : "453091",

              "cardExpiry" : {
                "month" : 12,
                "year" : 2019
              },
              "cardType" : "VI",
              "paymentToken" : "CaBP0abDKgROjYU",
              "billingAddressId" : "81ffcddf-ad82-40d2-aaa0-c4f9c376ad65",
              "defaultCardIndicator" : false
            }
            
## Add a Bank Account to the Profile

The Customer Vault API allows you to store multiple Bank Accounts against your customer's Profile. For billing purposes, each Bank Account can be associated to a different Address, or all Bank Accounts can be associated to the same billing Address, depending on your business needs.

To add a Bank Account and associate it to the Address you created above, you must use the Profile ID (716adb4f-6b85-4089-ba9c-d9c0eb649cd7) and the Address ID (81ffcddf-ad82-40d2-aaa0-c4f9c376ad65) and initiate a POST request to one of the Bank Account endpoints.

When you use the Customer Vault API to create a Bank Account, the newly created Bank Account becomes part of the Profile that owns the Profile ID and Address ID (billingAddressId) you have used. The example below shows how to create an ACH Bank Account to add to a customer Profile.

Prior to trying the example, you should replace the [API key](#apikey) (after the -u) with the API key you have received.

            cURL -X POST https://api.test.paysafe.com/customervault/v1/profiles/716adb4f-6b85-4089-ba9c-d9c0eb649cd7/achbankaccounts \
            -u devcentre322:B-qa2-0-53625f86-302c021476f52bdc9deab7aea876bb28762e62f92fc6712d0214736abf501e9675e55940e83ef77f5c304edc7968 \
            -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
            -d ' {
                 "nickName": "John's RBC Business Bank Account",
                 "accountNumber": "511201",
                 "routingNumber": "123456789",
                 "accountHolderName": "XYZ Business",

                 "accountType": "CHECKING"
             }'
             
**Response**

            {
              "id": "6a275b7c-6f11-4ed1-ae77-21071724574a",
                "status": "ACTIVE",

                "billingAddressId": "60022f38-fd17-4731-909c-923930d0d5d4",

                "paymentToken": "CNjEzMTM4NDg1"
            }
            
## Create a Single-Use Token

The Customer Vault API allows you to create Single-Use Tokens, which are then used with a mobile device to process a purchase through the Card Payments API.

**Note:** You have to generate a new Single-Use Token for each Card Payments transaction you wish to process.

The example below shows you how to create an Apple Pay Single-Use Token. In the response, you will find a *paymentToken* value that you would include with your Authorization or Purchase requests.

Prior to trying the example, you should:

  * Replace the [API key](#apikey) (after the -u) with the API key you have received.
  * Replace the value for the *data* element with valid passkit encrypted payment data.
  * Replace the value for the *signature* element with valid payment signature and header data.
  * Replace the values for the *header* sub-elements with valid values from the iOS device.

## Process a Transaction Using a Payment Token

You can process payments using credit cards (Card Payments API) or bank accounts (Direct Debit API) that you have stored in the Customer Vault by referring to the *paymentToken* associated with the Card or Bank Account. In these cases, the payment token replaces all the Card or Bank Account information that otherwise might be included in the request (e.g., card number and expiry date).

  * When you added a Card to the Profile in the example above, you got back a *paymentToken* with the value of *CaBP0abDKgROjYU*. 

  * When you added a Bank Account to the Profile in the example above, you got back a *paymentToken* with the value of *CNjEzMTM4NDg1*.
 
You can process payments using a mobile device, e.g., with Apple Pay, by including the single-use *paymentToken* that is required for each mobile payment request.
  * When you created an Apple Pay Single-Use Token in the example above, you got back a *paymentToken* with the value of *ABC4AFQQBC5UR5H*.

To process a Card transaction using a payment token, you must use it to initiate a POST request to the auths endpoint in the Card Payments API. 

Prior to trying the example, you should replace the API key (after the -u) with the API key you have received.

The following example shows you how to process a credit card request using the *paymentToken* that represents that Card.

# Using the Console Window
To configure and test the example in the Console window, select the "Switch to Console" button.
In the Console window, you can update the API endpoint, parameters, headers, and request body. For example, you can update the API endpoint with the id of the required order or transaction for a lookup request or include your account_id, which is required when using some API endpoints. You can also include your Test or Live account user name and password  (for details, see Using your API key below). 
When you are ready to test your example, you can switch  between the Production and Mock server environment:
* Production server – calls the resource on the Paysafe test production system. You should replace with your test account details to test these examples.
* Mock server – local test environment which returns an example response. No account details are required, as you can use those provided in the request example.
To call the API resource, click the "Call Resource" button. The response is displayed in the Console window.
